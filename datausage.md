🛡️ Image Upload – Friendly Q&A

Q: Why does this app upload my image?
A: Simple 😄
Search engines don’t allow apps to upload images directly (to prevent misuse). So the app uploads your image first to create a safe, usable link.

Q: Where does my image go?
A: It goes to trusted third-party services:

Litterbox → Auto-deleted after 1 hour (as per their policy)

Catbox → Used only when Litterbox fails (may be stored permanently)

Q: Should I upload personal or private images?
A: Please don’t 🙏
Avoid uploading personal photos, private documents, IDs, or anything sensitive. Only search images that are safe and non-personal.

Q: Does the app store my images or links?
A: Nope ✅
Your images and URLs are not stored, tracked, or logged by this app.

Q: Can the developer see my images or links?
A: No 👀
There is:

No developer server

No access to your uploads

No access to your generated URLs

Your data stays only between you, the hosting service, and the search engine.

Q: Are Litterbox and Catbox safe?
A: They are widely used by many users and developers for anonymous uploads.
They are not open source, so you should read their own privacy and data usage policies if you want a deeper understanding.

Q: Will my images stay online forever?
A: Maybe, yes ⚠️
Your searched images can remain on:

Search engine servers

Catbox servers (permanent storage)

Caches and backups

This is why you should never upload private or personal images.

🔔 Important Reminder

Please read the privacy and data usage policies of Litterbox and Catbox for a better understanding of how your data may be handled.

This app is just a tool to help you search images and does not control how third-party services store data.
